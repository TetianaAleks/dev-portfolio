              My journey into IT began early â€” I attended a specialized school
              with a strong emphasis on technology, where I consistently placed
              among the top students at IT competitions and Olympiads. Inspired
              by a passion for problem-solving and innovation, I pursued a
              Master's degree in Automation and Computer-Integrated
              Technologies, where I deepened my skills in engineering and
              software development. Throughout my academic and professional
              path, I have focused primarily on frontend development, building
              modern, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. Looking
              ahead, I am expanding my expertise into full-stack development and
              AI technologies to create even more powerful digital solutions.
