              My journey into IT began early â€” I attended a specialized school
              with a strong emphasis on technology, where I consistently placed
              among the top students at IT competitions and Olympiads. Inspired
              by my passion for problem-solving and innovation, I pursued a
              Master's degree in Automation and Computer-Integrated
              Technologies, deepening my expertise in engineering and software
              development. Throughout my academic and professional path, I have
              built a strong foundation in full-stack development, focusing on
              creating modern, scalable, and AI-driven digital solutions. Today,
              I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of what's possible,
              learning continuously, and building solutions that make a
              difference.
